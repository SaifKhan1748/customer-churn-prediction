## 📖 Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges for businesses — losing customers directly impacts revenue.  
This project builds an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** to **predict which customers are at risk of leaving**, using demographic info, usage behavior, and account history.  

The project includes:  
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**  
- 🤖 **Model Training** with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost  
- 📊 **Evaluation Metrics** (ROC-AUC, F1-score, Precision-Recall)  
- 🌐 **Streamlit Web App** for interactive predictions  
- 💾 **Downloadable Predictions** in CSV

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git
cd customer-churn-prediction
````

2. **Create a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # (Linux/Mac)
.venv\Scripts\activate      # (Windows)
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Train the model**

```bash
python -m src.train --data data/sample_raw.csv --out models/churn_pipeline.joblib
```

5. **Run batch prediction**

```bash
python -m src.predict --input data/sample_raw.csv --model models/churn_pipeline.joblib --out preds.csv
```

6. **Launch Streamlit app**

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

## 📊 Model Performance

| Model               | ROC-AUC | Accuracy | F1-Score |
| ------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.82    | 0.78     | 0.75     |
| Random Forest       | 0.86    | 0.80     | 0.77     |
| XGBoost (final)     | 0.89    | 0.83     | 0.80     |

✅ Copy this into your repo as `README.md` → and it will look **clean and professional**.  
Later, you can add a **screenshot of your Streamlit app** where I marked *(Insert screenshot here)*.
